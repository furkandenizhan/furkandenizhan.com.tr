Hello, and welcome to my personal web page. Or, to be honest, welcome to my corner of the digital landfill!

Firstly, I've always been more than a DevOps/SysOps or network engineer. I'm an ideation engineer. As humans, we think about tens of thousands of things every day, we come up with hundreds of new ideas every day. We humans are really supercomputers. At least as long as AI doesn't destroy us :) So how many of these tens of thousands of thoughts do we take into account? Or, to be more precise, how many of those thousands of thoughts that come into our heads do we act on? Almost none. We do not even dwell on our ideas that we think are creative and wonderful. What if we told you that we have the opportunity to work on these ideas and create miracles? Well, that's me. I chase great ideas and I run towards dreams that are considered 'impossible'.

Learning is a continuous process that we, as human beings, continue as long as we live. Even when I think I have solved a task and done it in the best way, I always realise that there is always more to learn. As long as we are alive, there is always more to learn. As long as we survive and want to learn.
